## About the challenge :open_file_folder::

In this challenge, you should create an application to train what you've learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where your main objective is to create a blog from scratch. You will receive a practically blank application that should consume Prismic data and have the interface implemented according to Figma's layout. You will have access to several files to implement:

- Global, common and individual stylizations;
- Import from Google fonts;
- Paging posts;
- Estimated post reading time calculation;
- Generation of static pages with `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` methods;
- Date formatting with `date-fns`;
- Use of icons with `react-icons`;
- HTTP requests with `fetch`;
- Between others.

In this challenge, you should create an application to train what you've learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where your main objective is to add features to an existing project. We will use as a basis the solution you developed for the mandatory challenge:

You must implement the following features in the project:

- Comments with Utteranc;
- Preview of the Prismic document;
- Navigation between previous and next post;
- Post editing information.

Below we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done ðŸš€

## Getting started :desktop_computer::
